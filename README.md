# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

The application runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery, along with the Day.js library for date and time manipulation.


## Features

- The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
- Timeblocks for standard business hours are color-coded to indicate past, present, or future.
- Clicking into a timeblock allows you to enter an event.
- Events are saved to local storage and persist upon refreshing the page.
